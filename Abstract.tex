\section*{Abstract}

Oxygen is carried by red blood cells in the blood. It is supplied to organs, muscles and generally to the tissue through complex networks. This microvascular network consists of micro-sized capillaries, that can be extracted from ex vivo mice organs. This work is part of the NCCR Kidney project, and aimed to develop and analyze computational models to understand the gradients of Oxygen in the tissue, and have a better understanding of what methods might be the most accurate ones in order to get physiologically correct results.
