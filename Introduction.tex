\subsection{Motivation}

This thesis aims to understand and specify how blood flow and oxygen transport has been simulated until today. The goal is to see how far existing methods, especially the Greens' Method developed by Secomb et. al can produce accurate results, and differentiate between different networks. A new model using an open source software called DuMuX was implemented to offer a different approach for oxygen transport and diffusion simulations.
